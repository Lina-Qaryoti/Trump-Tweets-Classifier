# Trump-Tweets-Classifier
Classifying Donald Trump's Tweets from 2009-2019 using classical Machine Learning Techniques


This project attempts to collect the entire dataset of  Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets since 2009 till 2019 along with the tweets of random users collected, to understand the patterns and words used by Trump in his tweets. Data will be cleaned using text analysis and data processing techniques to filter the tweets to be used in feature extraction which will be fed to classical machine learning models used for text based applications.

Two Datasets used were taken from the following resources:
1- http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/ (Archive containing Donald Trump tweets since 2009- to date)
2-https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/tweet-files-for-gender-guessing#twitgen_train_201906011956.csv (Three Datasets containing random tweets by users)

The 3 notebooks named:
1-Cleaning Trump
2-Cleaning Users
3-Trump Classifier
The two 'Cleaning' notebooks contain just a quick reformat of the csv file before merging them into one csv named 'merged2'
